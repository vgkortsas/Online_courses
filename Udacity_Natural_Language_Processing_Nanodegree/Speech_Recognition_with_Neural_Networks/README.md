# Speech Recognition with Neural Networks


In this notebook, we build a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) pipeline.

We begin by investigating the [LibriSpeech dataset](http://www.openslr.org/12/) that will be used to train and evaluate the models. The algorithm will first convert any raw audio to feature representations that are commonly used for ASR. We then build neural networks that can map these audio features to transcribed text. After learning about the basic types of layers that are often used for deep learning-based approaches to ASR, we will engage in our own investigations by creating and testing your own state-of-the-art models. Throughout the notebook, recommended research papers are provided for additional reading and links to GitHub repositories with interesting implementations.
