# Capstone Project


## Project description
Build a pipeline, using a convolutional neural network (CNN), that can be used within a web or mobile app to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

## Implementation
[Jupyter Notebook]()


## Notes
- The dog_app.ipynb file has the fully functional code.

- The folder images contains all the images on which I tried run_app

- The model_scratch.pt file has the trained model from scratch.

- The model_transfer.pt file has the trained model when we apply transfer learning using ResNet50.
